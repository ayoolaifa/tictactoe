This is an andriod application of the famous childhood game, Tic-Tac-Toe. This was created during my final year of A-Level. 
The Application was made using andriod studio and i predominantly used java for the project.
The single player mode allows user to face of against a computer.
The computer uses the minimax algorithm to find the most optimal move to make,
Unfortunately, I could not find a way to allow players to choose the difficulty level for the computer.
